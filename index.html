        <h1>West Highland White Terriers (Westies)</h1>
        <p>Although small in size the West Highland White Terrier (commonly known as the Westie) is a little spitfire. Stubborn, playful, friendly, and energetic the Westie makes a great family dog. However, the Westie should not be around small children ages 1-5 alone and is recommend as maybe not a first dog owners breed of choice. That being said Westies are truly lovable and loyal dogs. They have a recognizable white coat and two dark brown (almost black) eyes. The Westie is prone to barking since they are in the terrier group, seeing a squirrel or a scooter can make the Westie bark and they have a very loud bark.</p>

        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p>Westies can be very hard to train. Their stubbornness and independence make the Westie full of personality, but these traits make it harder to train the Westie is basic commands. Train your Westie (if you can) from an early age. Enrolling your Westie in “puppy school” can help them become more acquainted with understanding basic commands and you could even train them on some fun tricks.  </p>

        <h2>Living and Family</h2>
        <p>
          The Westie can live in an apartment but taking them for lots of walks is key to keeping them happy. Digging is another fun little quirk the Westie is prone to do. They are hunting dogs and are used to digging for finding rodents. Westies are not lap dogs, they love the outdoors and can join you on long walks and even hikes.</p>
    
        <p>These little dogs are great family dogs. Playful and fun they can be great dogs for kids. Westies sense of loyalty will help this dog bond quick to a family. However, if you have small children around the ages of 1-5 you should supervise them to make sure they don’t accidently provoke the dog.</p>
